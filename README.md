# NotesAppWithSQLlite 📝📱
NotesAppWithSQLlite is a simple, offline-first note-taking application for Android. It demonstrates the use of modern Android development practices, including Kotlin, Room for local database storage, MVVM architecture, and Coroutines for asynchronous operations. 🚀

## Features ✨

-   **Create & Edit Notes:** Easily add new notes or modify existing ones. ➕🖊️
-   **View Notes:** All notes are displayed in a clean, scrollable list on the main screen, sorted by the most recently modified. 📋⏱️
-   **Delete Notes:** Remove notes with a long-press gesture, which prompts a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion. 🗑️✅
-   **Local Persistence:** All notes are saved locally on the device using a SQLite database, ensuring your data is always available, even without an internet connection. 💾📶
-   **Modern UI:** A simple and intuitive user interface built with Material Components. 🎨✨

## Tech Stack & Architecture 🛠️🏗️

This project is built using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern.

-   **Language:** [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 🧩
-   **Architecture:** MVVM 🧠
    -   **View:** Activities (`MainActivity`, `NoteEditorActivity`) and a `RecyclerView` with a custom `NoteAdapter`. 👀
    -   **ViewModel:** `MainActivityViewModel` to expose data streams and handle UI logic. 🔄
    -   **Model:** A repository (`NoteRepo`) that abstracts the data source. 📦
-   **Database:** [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) as an abstraction layer over SQLite. 🗃️
-   **Asynchronous Programming:** [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) for managing background threads and database operations. ⚡🌊
-   **UI:** Android XML with `ConstraintLayout`, `CardView`, and `MaterialButton`. 📐🔘
-   **Dependency Management:** [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) with the versions catalog (`libs.versions.toml`). 🧰

## Project Structure 📂🧭
